# battleships-lambda

Welcome to Battleships!

A classic two-player game where players take turns guessing the location of the other player's ships on a grid. The goal of the game is to sink all of the opponent's ships before they sink yours.


This is the lambda function for the [battleship repo](https://github.com/adamtommo/battleships).
